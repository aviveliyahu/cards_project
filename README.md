<h1><u>Card wars project</u></h1>
<h4>In this project i've tested my class creation skills, combining different classes into use together and game-logic that need to be translated into a code.</h4>
<ins>The rules of the games are simple</ins><br>
  1. The deck contains all cards combination available (4 suits of cards, 13 card numbers)<br>
  2. The deck is shuffled, and split to half for each player (two players can play this game)<br>
  3. Each player draws a card, if his card is greater than the opponent's card - he wins, and take all the cards for him self<br>
  4. If theres a draw, each player draws 5 cards and the last card is compared between them.<br>
    * If one of the players doesnt have 5 cards to draw in that case - he is losing the game.<br>
  5. A player wins in by the above situation, or when he has all the cards.
